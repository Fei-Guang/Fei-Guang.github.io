Admin URL
As per the SSL section above, admin.url can be used to specify a different protocol for your admin panel. It can also be used to specify a different hostname (domain name). It cannot be used to affect the path at which the admin panel is served (this is always /ghost/).

"admin": { 
  "url": "http://example.com" 
}
