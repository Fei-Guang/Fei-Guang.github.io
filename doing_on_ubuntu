2: mysql etf8 

For the recent version of MySQL,

default-character-set = utf8
causes a problem. It's deprecated I think.

As Justin Ball says in "Upgrade to MySQL 5.5.12 and now MySQL wonâ€™t start, you should:

Remove that directive and you should be good.
Then your configuration file ('/etc/my.cnf' for example) should look like that:
[mysqld]
collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci
init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'
character-set-server = utf8
Restart MySQL.
For making sure, your MySQL is UTF-8, run the following queries in your MySQL prompt:
First query:

 mysql> show variables like 'char%';
 
 
 3: locale 
 /etc/environment:
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

5:show the last queries executed on MySQL temporaly

If you prefer to output to a file:

SET GLOBAL log_output = "FILE"; which is set by default.
#set absolute path will report error,mysql.log=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.log
SET GLOBAL general_log_file = "mysql.log";
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';

tail -f /var/lib/mysql/mysql.log
